Library Management System (C++)
Overview
This project is a simple Library Management System implemented in C++. It allows users to add books, search for books, borrow, and return books while handling exceptions to ensure smooth functionality.
Features
* ?? Manage Books - Add and display books in the library.
* ?? Search Books - Find books by title.
* ??? Borrow & Return Books - Users can borrow and return books.
* ?? Exception Handling - Prevents borrowing unavailable books.
* ?? Scalability - Uses vectors to store books dynamically.
Project Structure
1. Class `Book` - Represents a book (title, author, availability).
2. Class `Library` - Manages book storage and search functionality.
3. Class `User` - Allows borrowing and returning books.
4. Exception Handling - Ensures books are not borrowed if unavailable.
Enhancements & Next Steps
* ? File Handling - Save & load book data.
* ? User Interaction - Add a menu-driven system.
* ? Multiple Users - Allow multiple user accounts.
* ? GUI Integration - Implement using Qt for C++.
Project Timeline (3 Days)
DayTasksDay 1Implement `Book`, `Library`, and `User` classes. Add books and search functionality.Day 2Implement borrowing/returning books and exception handling.Day 3Enhance user interaction, add optional file handling, and test edge cases.Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on way to practice classes, vectors, and exception handling in C++. It simulates a real-world system with structured logic and extensibility for future improvements.
?? Happy Coding!
